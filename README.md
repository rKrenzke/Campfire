# Getting Started with MI-Campfire

Version 1.0 (Current)
This app is designed for those looking to browse and save State and National Parks Service campsites they would like to visit in Michigan.  Users can register new accounts or login to an existing account to save a personal list of National Parks Service campsites they are interested in. Users can also create a custom pack list for each trip.

Version 2.0
- Expanded API functionality to include State Parks
- Expanded trip sharing functionality where users can find and connect with friends, share saved trips, and individually update a shared packing list so everyone can see who is bringing which items.  Additional features may include ability to email finished pack list to campers, and expanded reservation funcationality.  

Known Issues:
- Checkboxes on user's saved sites page do not change visual appearence on click.  However, changes to these options are correctly logged and saved for the user's account.
- If the user does not have any saved trips, the background sometimes appears blank when navigating to the My Campfires nav link.
- The More Sites page button in the Search component takes two clicks initially to functional correctly.
